When we are working with HTML, by default you can send plain text over the requests to our server. 
An image is not plain text.

ENCTYPE <<--- allows the form to be able to upload files to the server. 

  <form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="file" name="photo">
    <input type="submit" value="Save">
  </form>
